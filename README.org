** fsp
A small program.

** Note
For this program you shouldn't use the upstream version of TinyCC,
as discard_offset heavily depends on the offset of the binary file.
Later versions of TinyCC somehow produces larger (a few bytes more
to say) binary than the this version and doesn't produces section
names at end, it will mess up as from wrong offset bytes will be
removed.
